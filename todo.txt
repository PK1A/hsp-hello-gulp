- add some kind of automated tests on Travis-CI to make sure that this thing actually works
    - this would be a great excuse to introduce Selenium testing :-)

- make the DOM-based test pass
    - how to include hashtester / evntgenerator?
        - jQuery is the problem right now
            - peer dependency => no, it won't solve the issue :-/
            - ideas:
                (1) Change all the references so those are relative, move jQuery to be a peer dependency => this is not enough since we need to take care of the thing in a generated template....
                (2) Add mapping capability to karma / noder -> but this feels wrong somehow...
            - questions: what are dependencies of the runtime (in a browser): jQuery, ...

    - we still got a problem about the generated require('hsp/...') in the included template!!!
        - it is always about the same thing - one root folder (!); possible solutions:
            - a configuration option
                - for the required thing
                - for a reference to the runtime
        - bahhhh.... transpiler also assumes things: var $set=require("hsp/$set");

- improve
    - can I use jQuery / other stuff to easily get my hand on the DOM?
    - what is the added value of the wrapper? like refresh?

- how does it influence folder structure of hsp?
- are there any other points from the backlog around this area => yes, enter text for example
